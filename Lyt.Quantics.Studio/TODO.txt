TODO: Framework: 
----------------

	Disabling / Enabling Glyph buttons fails via data binding. (Error in property?) 

	Ability to drag modal dialogs 

	Annoying flash when replacing a modal dialog by a new one
		(need some kind of dismiss and replace/run API) 

TODO: Engine: 
-------------

	Priority:	
	=>	Support for variable control and target qubits for gates, such as : 
			(DONE) Binary Gates with non consecutive qubits (Ex: swap 0 and 2)
			( => ) Ternary Gates with non consecutive qubits 

	Review all circuits for names and descriptions to display on UI 
		(when hovering on the toolbox) 
	
	??? Include Author in computer metadata

	Process gates linearly  (Doable?) 

	Optimize Identity gates (Doable?) 
	
TODO: Studio : 
--------------

	Priority:	
		Turn off measure on some qubits like QRyd is doing, use in amplitude histogram 
		Finalize support for creation of controlled gates from unary ones 
		BUG: Can't dismiss toasts in Computer view 
		Ghost view or some hint when hovering on a valid drop location 

	BUG: Incorrect behaviour of the "regular/Test" switch after closing a circuit.

	BUG: Amplitudes histogram shows up after loading another model.

	"Frameworkization" of drag/drop (Almost done)

	Ability to give names to qubits (Alice, Bob,...)

	Insert a stage 

	Open Folder in Saved Projects view 
		
	Spinner for 9 or 10 qubits 
	
	Warning for slow computations at 9 and 10 qubits

	Ability to cancel a run at 9 and 10 qubits
		
	Nicer app icon 
	
	Nicer Measure icon 
	
	Implement Stepping on UI 
	
	Monospaced font for labels in the Amplitudes view

	??? Export circuits to Q# or other languges 

	??? Help Window

	??? Settings Window
