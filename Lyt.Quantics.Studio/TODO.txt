TODO: Framework: 
----------------

	Disabling / Enabling Glyph buttons fails via data binding. (Error in property?) 

	Ability to drag modal dialogs 

	Annoying flash when replacing a modal dialog by a new one
		(need some kind of dismiss and replace/run API) 

TODO: Engine: 
-------------

	??? Include Author in computer metadata

	Process gates linearly  (Doable?) 

	Optimize Identity gates (Doable?) 
	
TODO: Studio : 
--------------

	Priorities:	
		Finalize support for creation of controlled gates from unary ones 
		Save view (because it's a view, not a dialog) cannot be cancelled with Escape.

	BUG: Can't dismiss toasts in Computer view 

	BUG: Sometimes showing a toasted Error on dropping Swap gate : "overlapping targets"

	BUG: Incorrect behaviour of the "Regular/Test" switch after closing a circuit.

	BUG: Amplitudes histogram shows up after loading another model.

	Ability to add or remove qubits at index 0 with shift key 

	Show "wave function" in Amplitude view (See in QRyd)

	Ability to give names to qubits (Alice, Bob,...)

	Ability to Insert a stage 

	Open Folder in Saved Projects view 
		
	Spinner for 9 or 10 qubits and above
	
	Warning for slow computations at 9 and 10 qubits and above

	Ability to cancel a run at 9 and 10 qubits
		
	Nicer app icon 
	
	Nicer Measure icon 
		
	Monospaced font for labels in the Amplitudes view

	??? Export circuits to Q# or other languges
