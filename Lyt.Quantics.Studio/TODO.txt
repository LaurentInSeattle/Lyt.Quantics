TODO: Framework: 
----------------

	Disabling / Enabling Glyph buttons fails via data binding. (Error in property?) 

	Annoying flash when replacing a modal dialog by a new one
		(need some kind of dismiss and replace/run API) 

	??? Ability to drag modal dialogs 

TODO: Engine: 
-------------

	Process gates linearly, optimizing Identity gates (Doable?) 

	??? Include Author in computer metadata
	
TODO: Studio : 
--------------

	Priorities:	
		"Flipped" Controlled Gates not working properly 

	Allow editing angles on controlled rotation and phase gates

	BUG: Can't dismiss toasts in Computer view 

	BUG: Sometimes showing a toasted Error on dropping Swap gate : "overlapping targets"

	BUG: Incorrect behaviour of the "Regular/Test" switch after closing a circuit.

	BUG: Amplitudes histogram shows up after loading another model.

	Show Bloch spheres (or their projections)
		See: https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/10116/how-to-get-the-bloch-sphere-angles-given-an-arbitrary-qubit
			Pitch => Theta = 2 ArcCos ( | Alpha | ) 
			  Yaw => Phi = Phase ( Beta * Conjugate( Alpha ) / ( |Alpha| * |Beta| ) )

	Show "wave function" in Amplitude view (See in QRyd)

	Ability to give names to qubits (Alice, Bob,...)

	Ability to Insert a stage 

	Open Folder in Saved Projects view 

	Run computer in background thread. 
		
	Spinner for 9 or 10 qubits and above
	
	Warning for slow computations at 9 and 10 qubits and above

	Ability to cancel a run at 9 and 10 qubits
		
	Nicer app icon 
	
	Nicer Measure icon 
		
	Monospaced font for labels in the Amplitudes view

	??? Ability to add or remove qubits at index 0 with shift key 

	??? Export circuits to Q# or other languges 

	??? Help Window

	??? Settings Window
