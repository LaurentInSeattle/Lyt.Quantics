TODO: Engine: 

Binary Gates with non consecutive qubits (Ex: swap 0 and 2)
Ternary Gates with non consecutive qubits 
Document gates, so that there's something to show when hovering 
Review all circuits for names and descriptions 
Improve Stepping 
Include Author in computer metadata

TODO: Studio : 

Dont rebuilt the computer when only changing qubits initial values
Spinner for 9 or 10 qubits 
Toolbar: Clear all qubits to |0> 
Toolbar: Filters for projects (Recent, etc) 
Toolbar: Filters for built-in projects  (Unit tests, etc)
Move a gate using Drag/drop
"Frameworkization" of drag/drop
Nicer app icon 
Measure icon 
Implement Stepping 
Toolbar: Show amplitudes per stage (slider)
Introduce one more lower level for amplitudes
Warning for slow computations at 9 and 10 qubits
Monospaced font for labels in the Amplitudes view
Warning for unsaved changes ? Run the save panel ? LOng Press ?
