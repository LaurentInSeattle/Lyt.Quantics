TODO: Framework: 
----------------

	Reorganize / classify assemblies between those Avalonia dependant and those independant
		Add interfaces if needed (Ex: IPropertyStore for Validation)
		Model, Persistence, Search, StateMachine, Validation are independant.

	Move Drag / Drop and other behaviors from Q-Studio to Framework 

	Splash screen support 

	NTH: Ability to drag modal dialogs 

	NTH: Validation should not directly depends on MVVM but use a Get/Set Interface 

TODO: Engine: 
-------------

	Priorities:	

	??? NEEDED:  Include Author in computer metadata
	
	FEATURE: Create a C# code sample that loads and runs a quantum circuit.

TODO: Studio : 
--------------

	Priorities:	

		BUG: Amplitudes histogram shows up after loading another model. (No repro, fixed?)
		BUG: QFT 2 bits sample broken 
	
	FEATURE: Allow editing angles on controlled rotation and phase gates			

	NTH: Ability to give names to qubits (Ex: Alice, Bob for teleport.)

	NTH: Show Bloch spheres (or their projections)
		See: https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/10116/how-to-get-the-bloch-sphere-angles-given-an-arbitrary-qubit
			Pitch => Theta = 2 ArcCos ( | Alpha | ) 
			  Yaw => Phi = Phase ( Beta * Conjugate( Alpha ) / ( |Alpha| * |Beta| ) )

	NTH: Show "wave function" in Amplitude view (See in QRyd)

	NTH: Ability to Insert a stage 

	NTH: Nicer app icon 
	
	NTH: Nicer Measure icon 
		
	??? NEEDED: Open Folder in Saved Projects view (Not portable to browser)

	??? NEEDED: Ability to add or remove qubits at index 0 with shift key 

	??? NEEDED: Export circuits to Q# or other languages  (which ones)

	??? NEEDED: Help / FAQ Window

	??? NEEDED: Settings Window
