TODO: Engine: 

Binary Gates with non consecutive qubits (Ex: swap 0 and 2)
Ternary Gates with non consecutive qubits 
Document gates, so that there's something to show when hovering 
Review all circuits for names and descriptions 
Improve Stepping 
Include Author and create date 

TODO: Studio : 

Clear all qubits to |0> 
Identify probabilities to known kets: |+> , etc (Doable ???)
Filters for projects (Recent, etc) 
Filters for built-in projects  (Unit tests, etc)
Add Save actions in Run View 
Save to file
Move a gate using Drag/drop
"Frameworkization" of drag/drop
Nicer app icon 
Implement Stepping 
Show amplitudes per stage (slider)
Amplitude QuBit label truncated at 6 quBits or more
Scroll amplitudes at 6 quBits or more
Scroll computer view at 16+ stages
Introduce one more level for amplitudes
Warning for slow computations at 9 or 10 qubits
Smaller width of minibars
