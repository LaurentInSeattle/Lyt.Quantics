TODO: Framework: 
----------------

	Reorganize / classify assemblies between those Avalonia dependant and those independant 
		Model, Persistence, Search, StateMachine, Validation are independant.

	NTH: Ability to drag modal dialogs 

	NTH: Validation should not directly depends on MVVM but use a Get/Set Interface 

TODO: Engine: 
-------------

	Priorities:	
		BUG: "Flipped" Controlled Gates not working properly 

	??? Include Author in computer metadata
	
	FEATURE: Create a C# code sample that loads and runs a quantum circuit.

TODO: Studio : 
--------------

	Priorities:	
		BUG: Editor creates invalid gates control / target qubits indices, 
			 often (always?) conflicting with Identity 
		BUG: Sometimes showing a toasted Error on dropping Swap gate : "overlapping targets"
			(could be related to the one above) 

		FEATURE: Swaps for 17 qubits

		FEATURE: Swaps for 18 qubits

		FEATURE: Ability to cancel a run at 16+ qubits

	FEATURE: Allow editing angles on controlled rotation and phase gates		

	FEATURE: Should create histogram entries view models in threads 	

	BUG: Computer view supports only 16 swimlanes for qubits.

	BUG: Gates renders shifted down in Computer view, starts to be visible at 8+ qubits.

	BUG: Horizontal scroll bar not always visible in Computer view.

	BUG: Amplitudes histogram shows up after loading another model.

	NTH: Show Bloch spheres (or their projections)
		See: https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/10116/how-to-get-the-bloch-sphere-angles-given-an-arbitrary-qubit
			Pitch => Theta = 2 ArcCos ( | Alpha | ) 
			  Yaw => Phi = Phase ( Beta * Conjugate( Alpha ) / ( |Alpha| * |Beta| ) )

	NTH: Show "wave function" in Amplitude view (See in QRyd)

	NTH: Ability to give names to qubits (Ex: Alice, Bob for teleport.)

	NTH: Ability to Insert a stage 

	NTH: Monospaced font for labels in the Amplitudes view

	NTH: Nicer app icon 
	
	NTH: Nicer Measure icon 
		
	??? Open Folder in Saved Projects view (Not portable to browser)

	??? Ability to add or remove qubits at index 0 with shift key 

	??? Export circuits to Q# or other languges 

	??? Help Window

	??? Settings Window
