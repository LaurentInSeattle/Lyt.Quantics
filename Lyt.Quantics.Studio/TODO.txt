TODO: Framework: 

	Disabling / Enabling Glyph buttons fails via data binding. (Error in property?) 

	Ability to drag modal dialogs 

	Annoying flash when replacing a modal dialog by a new one, need some kind of dismiss and run API

TODO: Engine: 

	Priority:	
	=>	Support for variable control and target qubits for gates, such as : 
			Binary Gates with non consecutive qubits (Ex: swap 0 and 2)
			Ternary Gates with non consecutive qubits 

	Process gates linearly  

	Process swap gates as just swappig qubits 

	Optimize Identity gates 

	Document gates, so that there's always something to show when hovering 
	
	Review all circuits for names and descriptions to display when hovering the toolbox
	
	Improve Stepping 

	??? Include Author in computer metadata

TODO: Studio : 

	Finalize support for creation of controlled gates from unary ones 

	Amplitudes histogram shows up after loading another model.

	"Frameworkization" of drag/drop (Almost done)

	Ghost view on valid drop location 

	Flag model as NOT dirty if OK to discard changes on close
	
	Wider slider in Amplitudes view 

	Duplicate stage indices at the top 

	Figure out the optimal height of a Slider, update dialogs accordingly (currently == 60) 

	BUG: Can't dismiss toasts in Computer view 

	Turn off measure on some qubits like QRyd is doing, use in amplitude histogram 
		
	Spinner for 9 or 10 qubits 
	
	Warning for slow computations at 9 and 10 qubits

	Toolbar: Filters for projects (Recent, etc) 
	
	Toolbar: Filters for built-in projects  (Unit tests, etc)
	
	Move a gate using Drag/drop
		
	Nicer app icon 
	
	Measure icon 
	
	Implement Stepping 
	
	Monospaced font for labels in the Amplitudes view

	??? Introduce one more lower level for amplitudes

	??? Export circuits to Q# or other languges 

	??? Help Window
