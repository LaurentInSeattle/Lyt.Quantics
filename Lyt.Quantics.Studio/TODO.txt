TODO: Framework: 

	Disabling / Enabling Glyph buttons fails via data binding. (Error in property?) 

	Ability to drag modal dialogs 

	Annoying flash when replacing a modal dialog by a new one, need some kind of dismiss and run API

TODO: Engine: 

	Support for variable control and target qubits for gates, such as : 
		Binary Gates with non consecutive qubits (Ex: swap 0 and 2)
		Ternary Gates with non consecutive qubits 

	Document gates, so that there's always something to show when hovering 
	
	Review all circuits for names and descriptions to display when hovering the toolbox
	
	Improve Stepping 

	??? Include Author in computer metadata

TODO: Studio : 

	Rounded border for dynamic gates 

	Dymanic gates cannot be removed bc no drag and drop

	Edit QuBits dialog:  Initial position of sliders to be improved. 
	
	Figure out the optimal height of a Slider, update dialogs accordingly (currently == 60) 

	Dynamic creation of binary or ternary gate views based on stage operator definitions

	==> UpdateUiGates : broken 

	BUG: Can't dismiss toasts in Computer view 

	Turn off measure on some qubits like QRyd is doing, use in amplitude histogram 
	
	Support creation of controlled gate 	
	
	=> BUG: Overwrite save creates new entries in the Load view 

	Hard to Repro now: 
		=> BUG: Delete does not remove the entry in the Load view 

	Spinner for 9 or 10 qubits 
	
	Warning for slow computations at 9 and 10 qubits

	Toolbar: Filters for projects (Recent, etc) 
	
	Toolbar: Filters for built-in projects  (Unit tests, etc)
	
	Move a gate using Drag/drop
	
	"Frameworkization" of drag/drop
	
	Nicer app icon 
	
	Measure icon 
	
	Implement Stepping 
	
	Monospaced font for labels in the Amplitudes view

	??? Introduce one more lower level for amplitudes

	??? Export circuits to Q# or other languges 

	??? Help Window
