TODO: Engine: 

Parametrized gates (Phase / Rotation / Controlled Gate)
Binary Gates with non consecutive qubits (Ex: swap 0 and 2)
Ternary Gates with non consecutive qubits 
Document gates, so that there's something to show when hovering 
Review all circuits for names and descriptions 
Improve Stepping 
??? Include Author in computer metadata

TODO: Studio : 

BUG => Cant close, after changes, discard...
BUG => Handle properly multiple successive saves 

Spinner for 9 or 10 qubits 
Toolbar: Filters for projects (Recent, etc) 
Toolbar: Filters for built-in projects  (Unit tests, etc)
Move a gate using Drag/drop
"Frameworkization" of drag/drop
Nicer app icon 
Measure icon 
Implement Stepping 
Introduce one more lower level for amplitudes
Warning for slow computations at 9 and 10 qubits
Monospaced font for labels in the Amplitudes view
